# Nice to meet you! 
My name is Valentina Osorio and I'm a software developer from New York, NY!

I love learning, and diving into software development has been a fun journey that pushes my creativity and allows me to explore it in new mediums. I love that the opportunity for learning in development is endless and I'm interested in continuing to learn about the backend, UX design as well as tech for good that advances social causes.
